        <h1 id="frames">Frames Parasite</h1>

        Frames Parasite is an alternative firmware
        for <a href="http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/frames/">Frames</a>. It
        adds the following main features to the module:
        <ul>
          <li>a new <i>quad Euclidean sequencer mode</i> that turns
          Frames into a quad algorithmic drum sequencer with built-in
          envelopes, VCA and mixer.</li>
          <li>a new <i>Shift Register sequencer mode</i> that turns
          Frames into a live random canon generator.</li>
          <li>an improved <i>quad sequencer mode</i> with sequence
          randomization and a step edition mode to easily enter
            sequences in sequencer mode.</li>
          <li>a new user interface to easily switch between modes (no
          more hard-to-remember button combos). There are five modes:
          keyframer, quad sequencer, shift register sequencer, quad
          LFO, quad Euclidean sequencer.</li>
          <li>four additional memory slots to save and load presets
          (sequences, mode, parameters etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All features of the official firmware are left untouched and
          still accessible.</p>

            manual</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

        <p>For full documentation, please see
          the <a href="http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/frames/manual">user
          manual</a> of Frames. I present hereafter only the features
          added/modified. In particular, all features concerning
          keyframer mode (the main mode from the stock firmware) are
          intact. Quad sequencer and LFO modes have been slightly
          improved.</p>


        <h3 id="mode">Mode-switching interface</h3>

        <p>Frames Parasite can be used in five different modes, each
        being a completely different function. To switch between
        modes, press the two buttons simultaneously. The frame knob
        blink quickly. Move one of the five knobs to select a feature:

        <ul>
          <li><b>Frame</b> knob: keyframer mode (the original mode
          of the stock firmware)</li>
          <li><b>Knob 1</b>: Quad sequencer mode (adapted from the
          stock firmware)</li>
          <li><b>Knob 2</b>: Shift register sequencer mode</li>
          <li><b>Knob 3</b>: Quad LFO (the easter egg in the stock firmware)</li>
          <li><b>Knob 4</b>: Euclidean sequencer mode</li>
        </ul>

        Press any button to enter the selected mode.</p>

        <blockquote><i>Note</i>: the keyframer and the two sequencer
        modes share the same data. This means that the keyframes you
        program will become sequences in the sequencer modes, and
        vice versa.</blockquote>

        <h3 id="euclidean">Euclidean sequencer mode</h3>

        <p>This mode uses each channel of Frames as an independent
        Euclidean sequencer that emits triggers, envelopes or even
        fully enveloped and mixed sound, depending on the inputs and
        outputs.</p>

        <h4>Introduction to Euclidean rhythms</h4>

        <p>An Euclidean sequencer is a trigger sequencer that generates
        rhythms based on filling as evenly as possible <i>n</i> pulses
        on a pattern of length <i>m</i> (with <i>m > n</i>). It will
        distribute the notes equally, leaving as few "holes" as
        possible. The parameters to generate such a rhythm are Length
        (the total number <i>m</i> of steps of the sequence), Fill
        (<i>n</i>, the number of notes in the sequence), and Rotate
        (which shifts/rotates the whole sequence). For instance, if
        Length=8, Fill=5 and Rotate=0, you might get the pattern:

        <pre>xx.xx.x.</pre>

        If you then set Rotate to 1, the pattern gets shifted to the right:

        <pre>.xx.xx.x</pre></p>

        <h4>Function Description</h4>

        <p>To enter Euclidean sequencer mode, press the two buttons
        simultaneously, turn <b>Knob 4</b> and press a button again.</p>

        <p>
          Feed a steady clock to the <b>Frame</b> CV input, and turn
          the attenuverter all the way up. By default, the Length of
          the pattern is 16. Each <b>Knob</b> (1-4) controls the Fill,
          from 0 to the Length. The <b>Frame</b> knob controls the
          Rotation between the four channel. It will set the rotation
          of all channels and go through each possibility, so it will
          be quite sensitive to small changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Long-press on the <b>Add</b> button to set the Length
          parameter of each channel with <b>Knob</b> 1-4. It ranges
          from 1 to 16 steps. Exit the Length-setting mode by pressing
          any button.
        </p>

        <p>By default, each time a step is activated, Frames emit a
        short trigger to the corresponding output. It is actually a
        short exponentially decaying envelope with very fast
        attack. Long-press on the <b>Del</b> button to change the
        shape of this envelope: <b>Knob</b> 1-4 will range from a
        short burst (CCW) to a long, decaying envelope (noon) to a
        triangle (CW).</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <i>Note:</i> These shapes are borrowed from Streams.
        </blockquote>

        Finally, the <b>Fr.Step</b> output and the keyframe LED output
        a complex combination of each channel's state; it can be used
        to modulate the incoming drum sounds or step a sequencer.

        <blockquote>
          <p><i>Patch Tip:</i> Feed four oscillators set to different
          timbre and pitches to the four input of Frames. Set up
          Euclidean rhythms on the four channels, and set the
          envelopes to various values in the first half of the
          knobs. Monitor the <b>Mix</b> output. Voil√†! Instant
          4-voices drum machine.</p>

          <p>Now take out one of the input set the +10V switch, and feed
          the output of this channel (which is now an envelope going
          from 10V ot 0V) to one parameter of an oscillator, for
          instance the DPO's Fold CV input.</p>

          <p>Finally, take the <b>Fr.Step</b> output to the FM input
          of this oscillator, and adjust the FM attenuator. You'll get
          a two-notes sequence, varying each time the Euclidean
          patterns are modified.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3 id="shift">Shift register sequencer mode</h3>

        <p>This mode is a generative, hands-on sequencer for generating
          complex melodic patterns, thanks to the idea of a <i>shift
            register</i>. It is similar to
          the <a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/synthesis-technology-e102-quad-temporal-shifter">Synthtech
            E102</a>, but acts only on the recorded step sequence, and
          with some randomness, making it also related to
          <a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/thonk-turing-machine-random-sequencer">Turing
            Machine</a>
            and <a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/mutable-instruments-branches">Branches</a>.</p>

        <h4>Introduction</h4>

        <p>To enter Shift register sequencer mode, press the two
          buttons simultaneously, turn <b>Knob</b> 2 and press a
          button again., long-press on the <b>Add</b> button.
        </p>

        <p>To explore it, program a pitch sequence by using <b>Knob
          1</b>, the <b>Frame</b> knob and the <b>Add</b>/<b>Del</b>
          buttons as in Keyframer or Sequencer modes (but on Channel 1
          only). Then, input a steady clock in the <b>Frame</b> CV
          input and turn the <b>Modulation</b> attenuator fully
          CW.</p>

         <p>Put <b>Knob</b>s (2-4) and the <b>Frame</b> knob at
          noon. Now, feed the four channel outputs to your favorite
          oscillators' 1V/Oct, and let the <b>Fr.Step</b> output
          trigger your envelopes. You should hear your sequence from
          each oscillator, but each time shifted by one step. Turn
           <b>Knob 4</b> CCW: the order of the notes in the sequence
           will be more and more randomized.</p>

        <p>Now turn <b>Knob 2</b> fully CW: the last 8 notes repeat in
          a loop: you just froze the sequence. Turn the <b>Frame</b>
          knob to adjust the length of this loop. Turn <b>Knob 2</b>
          back down to 2 o'clock, and put <b>Knob 3</b> to 2
          o'clock. You just transformed your initial sequence into a
          complex net of arpeggios. Now slowly turn
        <b>Knob 4</b> CW. The sequence will get more and more
        random. Finally, put <b>Knob 2</b> and <b>3</b> around 10
        o'clock: now most clock tick will be ignored randomly, making
        the sequencer step non-deterministically.</p>

        <h4>Function description</h4>

        <p>In this mode, only the sequence on Channel 1 is used. The
        other channels are ignored (but they are still in memory for
        when you exit the mode).</p>

        <p><b>Knob 1</b> and the big <b>Frame</b> knob allow you to edit
          the sequence as usual.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Note</i>: The VCAs that control the gain of each channels
          are a bit unstable: they are known to drift with temperature
          changes. Therefore, for tuned, melodic use, you should
          always use a quantizer, and/or reduce the range of the
          offset to reduce the possible drift. There is a jumper on
          the back of Frames that can be set to +5V instead of
          +10V. Alternatively, you can feed a constant reference
          voltage to the <b>All</b> input.
        </blockquote>

        When the <b>Modulation</b> attenuator is CW, a trigger in the
        the <b>Frame</b> CV input will make the clock tick. At each
        clock tick, two independent events can happen:

        <ul>
          <li>The sequencer can make a step. <b>Knob 2</b> controls
            when this happens: at noon, each clock tick makes the
            sequencer step; CCW, it acts as a clock divider for this
            event (from /1 to /8); CW, it randomly skips clock ticks,
            with a higher and higher probability. At each end of the
            button, it never steps.</li>

          <li>All values can get shifted one channel to the right: the
            gain of Channel 1 becomes the gain of Channel 2, 2 of 3, 3
            of 4 and 4 back to 1 (more on this last one below). <b>Knob
            3</b> controls when this happens, just like for (see
            above: CCW divides, CW randomly skips).</li>
        </ul>

        When either of these events occur, the <b>Fr. Step</b> ouput
        emits a short trigger.

        <blockquote>
          <i>Tip:</i> With both clock divider knobs at mutually prime
          values (4 and 5 for instance), you will get interesting
          rhythms out of the <b>Fr. Step</b> output, perfect to
          trigger envelopes.
        </blockquote>

        <p>There are two last small twist. First, when Channel 4 is
          shifted back on channel 1, some "error" can occur in the
          copy. The amount of error is controlled by <b>Knob 4</b>: at
          noon and below, there is no error and the shift register
          repeats perfectly; fully CW, the value copied back to channel
          1 is completely random.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Tip:</i> With <b>Knob 2</b> fully CW (no sequence step), and by
          turning randomness up and back down, you can capture little
          snippets of randomness, much like the Turing Machine.
        </blockquote>

        Second, the sequence order can be shuffled with <b>Knob
        4</b>. At noon and beyond, no shuffling appears and the
        sequence is played in order. Fully CCW, values of the sequence
        are completely random.

        <p>To sum up:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the big <b>Frame</b> knob selects a frame;</li>
          <li>a trigger in the <b>Frame</b> CV input makes the clock tick;</li>
          <li><b>Knob 1</b> edits the gain of the frame pointed to by
            the <b>Frame</b> knob;</li>
          <li><b>Knob 2</b> sets the number of clock tick it takes
          for the sequence to step;</li>
          <li><b>Knob 3</b> sets the number of clock tick it takes
          for a shift to occur; </li>
          <li>the <b>Knob 4</b> sets the amount of randomness
          introduced when shifting;</li>
          <li>the <b>Fr. Step</b> output emits a trigger whenever the
          gains are changed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="preset">Preset memory</h3>

        <p>Frames Parasite proposes five memory slots to save the state
         of the module (the mode you are in, your programmed sequence,
         additional parameters) in persistent memory: the main slot
         that is loaded on startup, plus 4 user slots. The startup
         slot is associated to the <b>Frame</b> knob, and the 4 user
          slots to <b>Knob</b>s 1-4.</p>

        <p>To save the current state of the module, press the <b>Add</b>
        button for more than 3s. The LEDs will indicate the current
        slot (no LEDs lit means the main slot). To change slot, turn
        the corresponding button. Press <b>Add</b> again to confirm,
        or <b>Del</b> to cancel the save.</p>

        <p>To load a recorded state, press the <b>Del</b> button for
        more than 3s. Turn the knob corresponding to the memory
        slot. Turning the <b>Frame</b> knob will select clearing the
        current settings and resetting the module to its initial
        state. Press <b>Del</b> again to confirm, or <b>Add</b> to
        cancel the save.</p>

        <h3 id="misc">Miscellaneous</h3>

        <h4>Quad sequencer mode</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>It was reported that editing a sequence in quad sequencer
              mode is difficult because there is no way to edit
              the <i>current</i> step (only the one pointed to by the
              big <b>Frame</b> knob, which does not have to be the one
              currently playing).

            <p>The <i>step edition mode</i> is a submode where each of the
              four <b>Knob</b>s adjusts the value of the current step. Of
              course, if the knob is not touched, the current step value
              doesn't change. While in quad sequencer mode, long-press
              the <b>Del</b> button. The frame LED will glow dimly. To exit
              the submode, press the <b>Del</b> button shortly.

              <blockquote>
                <i>Note</i>: in this mode, you cannot add or remove steps to
                the sequence, only edit them. If you want to add or remove
                steps, go back to the normal sequencer mode.
              </blockquote>

              The <b>Frame</b> knob doesn't point to a frame anymore. It
              controls the total number of steps of the sequence that will
              be played: fully CW, the full sequence is played; fully CCW,
              only one note will be played repeatedly.

              <blockquote>
                <i>Tip:</i> One popular way to edit the sequence is: feed a
                clock to the <b>Frame</b> CV input. Turn
                the <b>Modulation</b> attenuator to 0, and set the
                channel knobs for the first step. Now quickly turn
                the <b>Modulation</b> attenuator clockwise and back, so as
                to "catch" only one clock tick; the sequencer steps, and you
                can edit the second step... etc.
              </blockquote></li>

          <li>Long-pressing the <b>Add</b> button will randomize the
        values of all the steps of the current sequence. Careful, this
        operation is irreversible, so think about saving your
        sequences!</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Quad LFO mode</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>Press <b>Add</b> to reset the phase of all oscillators.</li>
              <li>Press <b>Del</b> to randomize the phase of all oscillators.</li>
              <li>The <b>Fr.Step</b> output follows the keyframe LED:
              it is high for half the cycle of Oscillator 1.</li>
            </ul>
