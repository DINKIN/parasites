        <h1 id="frames">Frames Parasite</h1>

        Frames Parasite is an alternative firmware
        for <a href="http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/frames/">Frames</a>. It
        adds the following main features to the module:
        <ul>
          <li>a new <i>Sequencer step edition mode</i> to easily enter
          sequences in sequencer mode.</li>
          <li>a new <i>Shift Register sequencer mode</i> that turns
          Frames into an advanced random canon generator.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All features of the official firmware are left untouched and
          still accessible as before.</p>

        <h2>Download and install</h2>

        <p>Click on the button to download the latest stable version,
          ready to play to your module:</p>
        
        <p class="center"><a href="https://github.com/mqtthiqs/parasites/releases/download/frames%2Bstep-mod2%2Bsr/frames.wav"
                             class="btn">Download latest version (v0.2)</a></p>

        <p>Once you downloaded the file, unzip it and follow the
          Firmware update procedure in
          the <a href="http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/frames/manual">official
            manual</a>.

          <h2>Documentation</h2>

        <p>For full documentation, please see
          the <a href="http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/frames/manual">user
            manual</a> of Frames. I present hereafter only the
          features added/modified.</p>

        <p>The changes affect only the <i>sequencer mode</i> descibed
        in the manual. All other features are intact. To enter
        sequencer mode, move the <b>Frame</b> knob so that it points
        to an existing keyframe (the <b>Keyframe</b> LED must be lit),
        and press the <b>Add</b> button 5 times.</p>

        <h3>Sequencer step edition mode</h3>

        <p>It was reported that editing a sequence in sequencer mode
          is difficult because there is no way to edit
          the <i>current</i> step (only the one pointed to by the
          big <b>Frame</b> knob, which does not have to be the one
          currently playing).</p>

        The <i>step edition mode</i> is a submode where each of the
        four gain knob adjusts the value of the current step. Of
        course, if the knob is not touched, the current step value
        doesn't change.

        While in sequencer mode, you enter it by long-pressing
        the <b>Del</b> button. The frame LED will glow dimly,
        indicating that you entered the step edition mode. To exit it,
        press the <b>Del</b> button shortly.

        <blockquote>
          <i>Note</i>: in this mode, you cannot add or remove steps to
          the sequence, only edit them. If you want to add or remove
          steps, go back to the normal sequencer mode.
        </blockquote>

        The <b>Frame</b> knob doesn't point to a frame anymore. It
        controls the total number of steps of the sequence that will
        be played: fully CW, the full sequence is played; fully CCW,
        only one note will be played repeatedly.

        <blockquote>
          <i>Tip:</i> One popular way to edit the sequence is: feed a
          clock to the <b>Frame</b> CV input. Turn
          the <b>Modulation</b> attenuator to 0, and set the
          channel knobs for the first step. Now quickly turn
          the <b>Modulation</b> attenuator clockwise and back, so as
          to "catch" only one clock tick; the sequencer steps, and you
          can edit the second step... etc.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Shift Register sequencer mode</h3>

        This mode is a generative, hands-on sequencer for generating
        complex melodic patterns, thanks to the idea of a <i>shift
          register</i>. It is similar to
        the <a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/synthesis-technology-e102-quad-temporal-shifter">Synthtech
        E102</a>, but acts only on the recorded step sequence, and
        with some randomness, making it also close to
        a <a href="https://www.modulargrid.net/e/thonk-turing-machine-random-sequencer">Turing
        Machine</a>.</p>

        <h4>Introduction</h4>

        <p>While in sequencer mode, long-press on the <b>Add</b>
          button. You are now in Shift Register sequencer mode. To
          exit it and get back to the normal sequencer mode, press
          again shortly on the <b>Add button</b>.
        </p>
        <p>To explore it, program a pitch sequence on Channel 1, enter
          this mode, input a clock in the <b>Frame</b> CV input with
          the
          <b>Modulation</b> attenuator fully CW. Now feed the four
          channel outputs to your favorite oscillators' 1V/Oct, and
          let the <b>Fr.Step</b> output trigger your envelopes.
          You should hear your sequence from each oscillator, but each
          time shifted by one step.</p>

        <p>Now turn <b>Knob 2</b> fully CW: the last 4 notes repeat in
        a loop: you just froze the sequence. Turn it back down to 11
        o'clock, and put <b>Knob 3</b> to 2 o'clock (you might want to
        increase the clock speed now). You just transformed your
        initial sequence into a complex net of arpeggios. Finally,
        slowly turn up <b>Knob 4</b>. The sequence will get more and
          more random.</p>

        <h4>Function description</h4>

        <p>In this mode, only the sequence on Channel 1 is used. The
        other channels are ignored (but they are still in memory for
        when you exit the mode).</p>


        <p><b>Knob 1</b> and the big <b>Frame</b> knob allow you to edit
          the sequence as usual.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Note</i>: The VCAs that control the gain of each channels
          are a bit unstable: they are known to drift with temperature
          changes. Therefore, for tuned, melodic use, you should
          always use a quantizer, and/or reduce the range of the
          offset to reduce the possible drift. There is a jumper on
          the back of Frames that can be set to +5V instead of
          +10V. Alternatively, you can feed a constant reference
          voltage to the <b>All</b> input.
        </blockquote>

        When the <b>Modulation</b> attenuator is CW, a trigger in the
        the <b>Frame</b> CV input will make Clouds' clock tick. At
        each clock tick, two independent events can happen:

        <ul>
          <li>The sequencer can make a step. <b>Knob 2</b> is a clock
            divider for this event: fully CCW, each clock tick makes
            the sequencer step; at 12 o'clock, it takes 4 clock tick
            for it to step; fully CW, it never steps.</li>

          <li>All values can get shifted one channel to the right: the
            gain of Channel 1 becomes the gain of Channel 2, 2 of 3, 3
            of 4 and 4 of 1 (more on this last one below). <b>Knob
            3</b> is a clock divider for this event: fully CCW, each
            clock tick shifts the gains; fully CW, they are never
            shifted.</li>
        </ul>

        When either of these events occur, the <b>Fr. Step</b> ouput
        emits a trigger.

        <blockquote>
          <i>Tip:</i> With both clock divider knobs at mutually prime
          values (4 and 5 for instance), you will get interesting
          rhythms out of the <b>Fr. Step</b> output, perfect to
          trigger envelopes.
        </blockquote>

        <p>There is a last small twist: when Channel 4 is shifted back on
        channel 1, some small "errors" can occur in the copy. The
        amount of error is controlled by <b>Knob 4</b>: fully CCW,
        there is no error and the small sequence of 4 CV gets repeated
        perfectly; fully CW, the value copied back to channel 1 is
        completely random.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Tip:</i> With <b>Knob 2</b> fully CW (no sequence step), and by
          turning randomness up and back down, you can capture little
          snippets of randomness, much like the Turing Machine.
        </blockquote>

        <p>To sum up:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the big <b>Frame</b> knob selects a frame;</li>
          <li>a trigger in the <b>Frame</b> CV input makes the clock tick;</li>
          <li><b>Knob 1</b> edits the gain of the frame pointed to by
            the <b>Frame</b> knob;</li>
          <li><b>Knob 2</b> sets the number of clock tick it takes
          for the sequence to step;</li>
          <li><b>Knob 3</b> sets the number of clock tick it takes
          for a shift to occur; </li>
          <li>the <b>Knob 4</b> sets the amount of randomness
          introduced when shifting;</li>
          <li>the <b>Fr. Step</b> output emits a trigger whenever the
          gains are changed.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Note</i>: in this mode, you cannot add or remove steps to
          the sequence, only edit them. If you want to add or remove
          steps, go back to the normal sequencer mode.
