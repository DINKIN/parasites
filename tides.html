        <h1 id="tides">Tides Parasite</h1>

        Tides Parasite is an alternative firmware
        for <a href="http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/tides/">Tides</a>. It
        adds the following features to the module:
        <ul>
          <li><i>Two-bumps</i>: a silky 14-voices harmonic oscillator
          with two spectral bumps or notches, control over centroids
          and width, harmonics selection, wave quality, a
          sub-oscillator, a 1-bit output, and a special harmonics
          shuffling output for unusual, random timbres.</li>
          <li><i>Two-drunks</i>: a complex duophonic random walk
          generator with selectable interpolation, driven by two
          altered clocks: one is jittery, the other simulates a biased
          coin toss. This mode is quite versatile and can be used as:
          an oscillator with PLL, a Bernoulli gate, a random trigger
          delay, a stepped, smooth or waveshaped random voltage
          generator, a random burst generator, a surprising filtered
          noise source... and probably more!
          <li>A built-in quantizer with a choice of 7 scales.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All features of the official firmware are left untouched
          and still accessible (with the
          exceptions <a href="#misc">mentioned below</a>).</p>

        <h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

        <p>For full documentation, please see
          the <a href="http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/tides/manual">user
          manual</a> of Tides. I present hereafter only the features
          added/modified.</p>


        <h3 id="mode">Mode-switching interface</h3>

        <p>Tides Parasite can be used in three different modes, each
        being a completely different function. To switch between
        modes, press the two buttons simultaneously. The LED
        corresponding to the current mode blinks quickly for two
        seconds. Whithin these two seconds, the two press buttons, called
          <b>Mode</b> and <b>Range</b> in the manual, can be used to
          select a mode (<b>Mode</b> goes forward, <b>Range</b> goes
          back). After two seconds of inactivity, the selected mode is
          entered and the LEDs and buttons reclaim their normal
          function. The modes are:

        <ul>
          <li>LED 1: function-generator mode (the original mode
          of the stock firmware)</li>
          <li>LED 2: <i>Two-bumps</i> mode: a harmonic oscillator.</li>
          <li>LED 3: <i>Two-drunks</i> mode: a random generator.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="quant">Quantizer</h3>

        <p>There is a built-in quantizer in Tides Parasite, which
        applies to all modes (including the original
        function-generator mode). To enable it, long-press on
        the <b>Mode</b> button (> 1s), then choose the active scale
        with the two buttons (<b>Mode</b> goes backwards, <b>Range</b>
        goes forward). The scales are indicated by a dim green LEDs
        using binary notation:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>○○○: No quantization</li>
          <li>●○○: Semitones</li>
          <li>○●○: Major</li>
          <li>●●○: Minor</li>
          <li>○○●: Whole tones</li>
          <li>●○●: Pentatonic minor</li>
          <li>○●●: Poor pentatonic</li>
          <li>●●●: Fifths</li>
        </ul>

        To exit scale selection, long-press Mode again (>1s); the
        chosen scale is then active. Note that the quantizer quantizes
        the Frequency knob and the V/Oct input. The FM input is not
        quantized.

        <blockquote>
          <i>Note:</i> To fine-tune the oscillator, you will have to
          use the FM attenuator together with an external offset. The
          fact that the Frequency knob is quantized (not only the
          V/Oct input, which would be more practical) is a hardware
          limitation.
        </blockquote>

        <h3 id="two-bumps"><i>Two-bumps</i> mode</h3>

        <p>A <i>harmonic generator</i> (also called an <i>additive
        synthesis</i> engine) produces its timbre by summing sinusoids
        of multiple frequencies (<i>harmonics</i>). Theoretically, all
        timbres can be reproduced this way, by choosing the right
        amplitude for each sine.</p>

        <p><i>Two-bumps</i> is a harmonic generator that sums 14
        harmonics. The timbre is shaped by choosing two "center
        frequencies", (with the <b>Shape</b> and <b>Slope</b> knobs)
        which select the loudest harmonics, and a "width", which is the
        amount of harmonics adjacent to the two centers that will also
        ring (the <b>Smoothness</b> knob, from fully CCW to
        noon). Additionally, you can have the exact mirror of what I
        just described. The bumps then become potholes: all harmonics
        ring by default and you are selecting the quietest harmonics,
        digging a notch of varying width in the spectrum (this is
        selected by the <b>Smoothness</b> knob, from noon to fully
        CW).</p>

        <p>The upper button (<b>Mode</b> button in the official
        manual) selects which harmonics can ring. When the LED is off,
        the first 14 harmonics ring: it is the default in most harmonic
        oscillators. When the LED is green, only the odd harmonics
        ring: the timbre is more "metallic", closer to a square wave.
        Finally, when the LED is red, only the octaves ring: the resulting
        timbre reminds a church organ.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Tip</i>: Put the oscillator in this "octaves" mode, put
          the width at noon and the frequency around 9 o'clock; 14
          octaves will ring at the same time, many of them way outside
          the audible range. Now feed a slow sawtooth to the 1V/Oct
          input, and adjust its amplitude so that it is 1V (or 2 or
          3... any round number of volts). Monitor the
          <b>Bipolar</b> output: you will hear a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone">Shepard-Risset infinite glissando</a>.
        </blockquote>

        <p>The lower button (<b>Range</b> button in the manual) allows
        to select the quality of the sine waves forming the
        sound. When the LED is off, the quality is maximum. When the
        LED is green, the sine is decimated a bit, leaving
        high-pitched aliasing noise: this gives more character to the
        sound. When the LED is red, the sine is decimated even more,
        for a stronger effect.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Note</i>: even in the maximum quality mode, you can sometimes
          hear a faint aliasing. That's a deliberate choice: the
          sampling rate is chosen rather low, so we can cram more
          harmonics in the available computing power.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Another note</i>: the effect of decimation is not exactly
          the same as feeding the output of <i>Two-bumps</i> into a
          bit-crusher, since all independent sine waves are decimated
          independently, each at its own frequency.
        </blockquote>

        <p>The main output is the <b>Bipolar</b> output. There are
        three alternate outputs. The <b>Low</b> output is a square
        sub-oscillator. The <b>High</b> output is a 1-bit version of
        the <b>Bipolar</b> signal. The <b>Unipolar</b> output is a
          unipolar and <i>permuted</i> version of the main signal: instead of
        sweeping through harmonics in order, all harmonics are
        shuffled randomly, giving new random but controllable timbres
        each time. The harmonics are reshuffled when a gate is
        received in the <b>Freeze</b> input.</p>

        To sum up:

        <ul>
          <li>The <b>Shape</b> and <b>Slope</b> knobs select the two
          center frequencies. The effect of second one is always a bit
          less pronounced than the effect of the first (for variety).</li>
          <li>The <b>Smoothness</b> knob selects how the timbre is
          affected by the center frequencies. From fully CCW to noon,
          only the harmonics at the center frequencies ring, and an
          increasing number of their neighbors. From noon to
          fully CW, all harmonics ring, except those at the centers,
          and an increasing number of their neighbors.</li>
          <li>The <b>Frequency</b> knob selects the fundamental
            frequency. The <b>FM</b> knob is an attenuverter for the
            corresponding CV input.</li>
          <li>The <b>Mode</b> switch selects the harmonics
          distribution between: all harmonics, odd harmonics, octaves.</li>
          <li>The <b>Range</b> switch selects the decimation of the
          individual sine waves between: no decimation, a bit, and a
          lot of decimation.</li>
          <li>A trigger in the <b>Trig</b> input will randomize the
            phase of each harmonics, acting as a kind of reset.</li>
          <li>Feed a clock in the <b>Clock</b> input and long-press
            the <b>Range</b> button to go into PLL mode (like on the
            original firmware).</li>
          <li>When not in PLL mode, a trigger in the <b>Clock</b>
          input will randomize the Harmonics distribution and
          Decimation settings.</li>
          <li>The <b>Level</b> input acts as a VCA (like on the
            original firmware).</li>
          <li>The <b>Bipolar</b> output is the main output.</li>
          <li>The <b>Unipolar</b> output is the unipolar, permuted
          harmonics output.</li>
          <li>When <b>Freeze</b> receives a gate, harmonics are
            permuted randomly on the <b>Unipolar</b> output.</li>
          <li>When <b>Trig</b> receives a gate, the phase of all harmonics are
            randomized on both outputs.</li>
          <li>The <b>High</b> output is a 1-bit version of
          the <b>Bipolar</b> output.</li>
          <li>The <b>Low</b> output is a square sub-oscillator, one
          octave down from the fundamental.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="two-drunks"><i>Two-drunks</i> mode</h3>

        <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">random
        walk</a>, also called a Drunkard's walk, is a stochastic
        process (a system that evolves randomly over time) that
        consists in repeatedly making small steps in random directions
        in a given space. Imagine a drunkard wandering in a city,
        taking a random direction at each crossing. Will (s)he ever
        make it back home?
        </p>

        <img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Random_walk_2500_animated.svg" alt="random walk" />

        <p><i>Two-drunks</i> is a dual random walk simulator. Each
          walk is timed by an independent clock featuring a form of
          randomness: one—Channel 1—is jittery, with control over the
          amount of jitter (from steady to completely random); the
          other—Channel 2—simulates a random biased coin toss, with
          control over the bias (from always ticking to ticking once
          every very long while). The <b>Low</b> and <b>High</b>
          outputs emit these clocks, respectively. They are both
          derived from the same main clock; the <b>Frequency</b> knob
          sets the frequency of this main clock.</p>

        <p>Each step leads the walk to a different place closeby: a
          new voltage at one of the <b>Unipolar</b> (Channel 1)
          or <b>Bipolar</b> (Channel 2) outputs. But the
          interpolation between the steps can be chosen: a square
          interpolation will have the classic effect of a sample and
          hold (only on a random walk, not on pure noise), but with
          the <b>Shape</b> knob you can also choose linear,
          sinusoidal, bouncy, pointy, woggly interpolations...  which
          will all sound different.</p>

          <i>Note</i>: If we don't want the output to appear
          "stalled", the interpolation time should depend on when the
          next clock tick will occur. And indeed, it does here:
          interpolation is slow when the next clock tick is far away,
          and fast when it is close. How can <i>Two-drunks</i> see
          into the future? Well, it uses mathematical tricks that
          would be very difficult to reproduce with isolated modules
          (say, a clock, a Bernoulli gate, and a function generator).
        </blockquote>

        <p>The challenge (or the fun, depending on the views) is that
          the two channels share the same parameters:
          the <b>Shape</b>, <b>Slope</b> and <b>Smoothness</b> knobs
          control the properties of the two walks... only inverted! For
          instance, if a knob is fully CCW, Channel 1 will act
          according to this knob's position, and Channel 2 according
          to the mirror position of this knob: as if it was fully
          CW. The two channels therefore only agree when knobs are at
          noon.</p>

        <p>The <b>Smoothness</b> knob sets the maximum size of one
        step (step sizes are random), that is, the length one walk is
        allowed to travel in one clock tick. Fully CCW, Channel 2 will
        be almost steady and Channel 1 will make very large steps (so
        large that its motion can almost be described as pure
        random). Fully CW, it will be the converse.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Note</i>: I <i>think</i> that, setting the clock very fast and
          the step size very small, you're getting closer and closer to what
          is
          called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian
            motion</a>, the motion of a single big particle in a fluid. But I
          might be wrong. Please correct me if I am.
        </blockquote>

        <p>The <b>Slope</b> knob sets the behavior of the two clocks. For
        Channel 1, it acts as a random delay of the main clock: fully
        CCW, delay is null and Channel 1's clock follows the main
        clock. Turning it CW, the random delay gets bigger and
        therefore the clock gets slower and more jittery. For Channel
        2, it acts as a probability that a main clock tick will
        produce a clock tick of Channel 2. Fully CW (remember the knob
        inversion), probability is 1 and it accurately follows the
        main clock. Turning it CCW, more and more clock ticks are
        dropped; at noon, the probability is 1/2; fully CCW, the
        probability is very small (but not null) and almost all
        clock ticks will be dropped.</p>

        <p>Since we're talking about clocks: the <b>FM</b> knob is an
        attenuverter for the eponymous CV input, as usual... but it
        also has a second function related to the two random
        clocks. For Channel 1 (jittery clock), it sets the random
        distribution of on/off states: at noon, you will get equally
        much time with the gate on than time with the clock off. Fully
        CCW, you will get much more time off than on, and fully CW
        more time on than off. For Channel 2 (coin-toss clock), it
        simply sets the pulse width of each clock tick.</p>

        <p><i>Two-drunks</i> can operate in three modes, as set by
          the <b>Mode</b> button. When the LED is off, it
          is <i>cycling</i>: the main clock is steadily ticking and
          stops only if a gate is received in the <b>Freeze</b>
          input. When the LED is green, it is in <i>trigger mode</i>:
          it will start a new cycle only upon receiving a trigger in
          the <b>Trig</b> input. Note that this trigger will also be
          delayed/randomly dropped on the clock outputs of Channels
          1/2. When the LED is red, it is in <i>gate mode</i>: the
          main clock will cycle as long as the <b>Trig</b> input is
          high.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Note</i>: both channels will always finish their current step
          before stopping, and will pick up where they left
          off. Therefore, there are no discontinuities in the output
          waveform (unless you choose a square interpolation of
          course).
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Another, sadder note</i>: in trigger mode, the interpolation time
          is fixed by the main clock; it will not correspond perfectly
          to the next trigger, and therefore will be "stalled"
          sometimes. Sorry, <i>Two-drunks</i> cannot
          <i>actually</i> see into the future. If your triggers are
          a steady clock, you might be better off using the PLL
          feature and the <b>Clock</b> input.
        </blockquote>

          <p>The <b>Range</b> button sets the frequency range of the
          oscillator, as usual: low (green LED), medium (LED off),
          audio rate (red LED).</p>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Two-drunks</i> is a surprisingly interesting noise
          generator. Set the <b>Range</b> to audio-rate, crank
          the <b>Frequency</b> to the maximum, and even optionally put
          a positive offset into the V/Oct input. Now listen to both
          outputs and wiggle the knobs carelessly. Self-patching is
          also highly recommended!
        </blockquote>

        To sum it up:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Frequency</b> sets the frequency of the main
            clock. The <b>Range</b> button sets its range.</li>
          <li><b>Shape</b> sets the interpolation curve between two
          steps. it morphs between: square (no interpolation), spiky,
          spiky and bouncy, linear, sinusoidal, bouncy, woggly.</li>
          <li><b>Slope</b> sets the clock mangling: random clock delay
          for Channel 1 and random coin toss for Channel 2.</li>
          <li><b>Smoothness</b> sets the maximum step size.</li>
          <li><b>FM</b> is an attenuator for the FM CV input, and
          also determines the output gates duration: random gate
          distribution for Channel 1, pulse width for Channel 2. </li>
          <li>The <b>Mode</b> switch toggles between trigger, gate
          and cycling mode.</li>
          <li>A trigger in <b>Trig</b> will trigger the clocks.</li>
          <li>While a gate is high in <b>Freeze</b>, all clocks are stalled.</li>
          <li>Long-pressing on the <b>Range</b> button, you get into
            PLL mode, which follows the <b>Clock</b> input (as in the
            default firmware).</li>
          <li>When not in PLL mode, a trigger in the <b>Clock</b>
            input will randomize the Range setting.</li>

          <li><b>Level</b> controls the amplitude of both channels.</li>
          <li><b>High</b> emits the clock of Channel 1.</li>
          <li><b>Low</b> emits the clock of Channel 2.</li>
          <li><b>Uni</b> is Channel 1's random walk.</li>
          <li><b>Bi</b> is Channel 2's random walk.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="misc">Miscellaneous</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>The calibration procedure is not accessed as in the
          stock firmware anymore (its space is now taken by the quantizer). To
          calibrate, turn on the module while holding the Rate
          knob. For the rest, follow the procedure of the official
          manual.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Function generator mode</h5>

        <ul>
          <li>The low-pass filter (<b>Smoothness</b> knob) now mutes
            the sound completely when fully CCW.
<blockquote>
  Tip: Feed it an envelope to use it as an LPG, it sounds great.
</blockquote>
          <li>At control rate (Rate LED off or green), the logarithmic
          and exponential waveforms have been accentuated, to make
          their effect more pronounced.</li>
          <li>At audio rate (Rate LED red), the Slope knob has a
          different action from fully CCW to noon: it sets the
          "compression factor" of the wave, an effect called <i>waveform
          stretching</i> by M. Puckette which results in more nasal or
            guttural tones.</li>

          <blockquote>
          <i>Note:</i> I implemented this because in the stock
          firwmare, there was no audible difference between the effect
          of Slope CW or CCW. This gives a bit more variation to
          sculpt the timbre.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <i>Another note:</i> this effect is not protected against
          aliasing. At high frequency or high spectral content, it
          will be dirty.
        </blockquote>


          <li>At audio rate (Rade LED red), the Low output is now a
          square sub-oscillator. When not in PLL mode, the Clock input
          acts as a gate and reset for this sub-oscillator: when Clock
          is high, the sub-oscillator is stopped. When Clock turns
          back low, the sub-oscillator resets and starts again.</li>

          <li>The response of the Slope button has been changed to
            exponential.</li>
          <li>The internal sizes of the tables generating the triangle
          and saw waves at audio rate have been reduced, to make space
          for the added features. It should not be noticeable (please
          contact me if you spot a reproducible difference).</li>
        </ul>
